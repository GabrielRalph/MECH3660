      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        In this report I will employ the knowledge taught in MECH3660 along with javascript code to analyse the cnc machining of a gearbox. The thoeretical machine outlined in the task breif is to mill the gearbox out of aluminium. For this I have chossen to use only motors A, C, F as 3 axis are only needed to mill the shape. I did consider using the angular motors to mill curved edges but this would require positioning point C to the center of the arc being milled without moving F. I thought that would be to difficult for not much benifit and so I decided to use only steppers A, C and F.

        Step distance
      </h1>
      <p>
        To calculate the step distance we are given \(P_{ls} = 1mm\) this means that after one rotation of the lead screw it will have moved \(1mm\) from its origanl location furthermore as the stepper motors step anlge is \(1.8^{\circ}\) we can calculate the distance one pulse will cause an axis to travel \[ds = 1mm \frac{1.8}{3600} = 0.005 mm\]
      </p>

        Operations
      </h1>
      <p>
        Bellow I have used javascript to simulate the process of moveing the router bit to the desired location. To do so I simulate a floating point position for the bit and only invoke a step if the floating point aproaches a division of \(ds = 0.005mm\), in wich case the a step will occur. The process will continue until the bit can move no closer to the desired location. This condition does create some bugs while performing circular motion of an arc thats subtending angle is greater than \(45^{\circ}\) as there can be points on the arc that have a greater distance to the end point than the distance of the chord.
